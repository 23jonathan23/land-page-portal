First work as a trainee in Portal Systems, the project was based on template Pheromone. That project was used ReactJS for the construction of an application front-end.

## Too much technology:
- react
- react-router-dom
- react-circular-progressbar
- react-icons
- react-move
- react-visibility-sensor
- d3-ease
- bootstrap
- HTML5
- CSS3
